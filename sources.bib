abstract = {Generative Design is a powerful tool allowing to fully exploit Additive Manufacturing potential. Topology Optimization, already established approach, requires an initial shape where material is removed until the desired result is reached. Generative Design presents a more complex approach, receiving several inputs such as objective, constraints, material and manufacturing technique used, it proposes a series of possible outcomes. Designer's role moves from creating the component shape from scratches to choose the best fitting option for the specific application. Using a reference case study, a plausible framework, describing how to properly select the final model, is investigated.}
